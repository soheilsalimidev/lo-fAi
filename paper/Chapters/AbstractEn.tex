\AbstractEn{
  The rise of content creation has led to an unprecedented demand for high-quality, copyright-free music for use in multimedia content. Lo-fi music, with its calming and soothing properties, has become a staple in video, podcast, and live stream production. However, obtaining high-quality, copyright-free lo-fi music can be a challenging and costly process. This project presents a novel approach to generating lo-fi music using a small language model, addressing the need for a cost-effective and scalable solution for content creators. We utilize the RWKV architecture, a state-of-the-art model that combines the efficiency of a transformer with the flexibility of a recurrent neural network.
  In this project, we focus on the technical aspects of generating lo-fi music, exploring the challenges of training a model to produce high-quality music of unlimited length. We trained two separate models, one for piano and one for drum instruments, to generate lo-fi music on demand. Our approach enables content creators to focus on their creative vision, rather than spending time and resources searching for suitable music.
